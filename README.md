================

InferiorTerminal is a library to prepare a reserved terminal to execute commands send from AppleScripts.
InferiorTerminal always send commands to a terminal specified with a name of which default value is “* Inferior Terminal *”.

If your AppleScripts to run commands in Terminal.app open a new terminal every time, too many windows will be opened.

If the profile “Inferior Terminal” does not exist, the settings set is generated by copying the default settings. By customizing the profile “Inferior Terminal”, you can change appearance of the terminal “* Inferior Terminal *”.

The name and the profile used for the terminal can be customized by utilizing a constructor method make_with.
